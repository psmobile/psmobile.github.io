I’m a second-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Daisuke Deguchi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OO215U0AAAAJ) and [Hiroshi Murase](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=T2O1-JgAAAAJ) at [VisLab](https://www.vislab.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp), Nagoya University, interested in high-level CV topics from detection to segmentation.

Prior to Nagoya University, I obtained my B.ENG and M.ENG in Information and Communication Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU), where I focused on medical image analysis.

Lately, I’ve been focusing on Zero-shot and Open-Vocabulary Vision tasks based on Vision-Language models and My CV can be obtained [here](Jialei Chen CV.pdf).
